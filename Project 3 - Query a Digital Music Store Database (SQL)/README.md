#Chinook Database

In this project, I queried the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, I assisted the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. To assist me in the queries , the schema for the Chinook Database was provided. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.
