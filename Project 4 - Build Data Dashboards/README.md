#Project Description

In this project, I created visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. These data visualizations tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. The work was a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization learnt, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
There were 3 different data sets you can choose from.
•	Flight Delays and Cancellations
•	US Census Demographic Data
•	Youtube Data from the US

#Supporting Materials
 Flight-Delays
 US Census Demographic Data
 Youtube Data

I worked on the US census Demographic Data (which is from a Kaggle Dataset) where I answered questions similar to:

•	Which states have the best transportation?
•	How does income and poverty look across America?
•	You can also come up with your own question!
