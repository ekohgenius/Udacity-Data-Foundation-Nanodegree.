#Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, so the data isn't perfect. It is a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others are missing). I had to decide how to analyze the data and then communicate my findings about it. Spreadsheets was used to make my analysis.
This was done by implementation of descriptive statistics and spreadsheets knowledge gained leading up to the project.

#Why this Project?
This project was an introduction to the data analysis process that was used throughout the rest of the Nanodegree program. In this project, I went through the process of calculating summary statistics and building visual methods of spreadsheet data to find interesting information out about Udacity students. The goal is wasn’t just to perform  analysis, but also that to communicate the results in a way that is clear and compelling.

#Project Details
The data used for this project was collected from Udacity students who responded to a survey. This project is made of two parts. For both parts I used the same dataset, which you can find as Surveydata3.csv  as a google sheet here.You will notice that some information has been removed to assure the privacy of the student respondents.
